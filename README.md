# Deep Learning Specialization - Coursera

This repository contains my personal notes on [DeepLearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai) Deep Learning specialization courses.

[DeepLearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai)  contains five courses which can be taken on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning). The five courses are:

1. [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://github.com/rahiakela/deep-learning-specialization/tree/main/course-1-neural-networks-and-deep-learning)
2. [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization](https://github.com/rahiakela/deep-learning-specialization/tree/main/course-2-improving-deep-neural-networks)
3. Structuring Machine Learning Projects(No code base)
4. [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/rahiakela/deep-learning-specialization/tree/main/course-4-convolutional-neural-networks)
5. [Sequence Models](https://github.com/rahiakela/deep-learning-specialization/tree/main/course-5-sequence-models-recurrent-neural-networks)


## About This Specialization (From the official Deep Learning Specialization page)
- Build and train deep neural networks, identify key architecture parameters, implement vectorized neural networks and deep learning to applications.

- Train test sets, analyze variance for DL applications, use standard techniques and optimization algorithms, and build neural networks in TensorFlow.

- Build a CNN and apply it to detection and recognition tasks, use neural style transfer to generate art, and apply algorithms to image and video data.

- Build and train RNNs, work with NLP and Word Embeddings, and use HuggingFace tokenizers and transformer models to perform NER and Question Answering.

The Deep Learning Specialization is a foundational program that will help you understand the capabilities, challenges, and consequences of deep learning and prepare you to participate in the development of leading-edge AI technology. 

In this Specialization, you will build and train neural network architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, LSTMs, Transformers, and learn how to make them better with strategies such as Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. Get ready to master theoretical concepts and their industry applications using Python and TensorFlow and tackle real-world cases such as speech recognition, music synthesis, chatbots, machine translation, natural language processing, and more.

AI is transforming many industries. The Deep Learning Specialization provides a pathway for you to take the definitive step in the world of AI by helping you gain the knowledge and skills to level up your career. Along the way, you will also get career advice from deep learning experts from industry and academia.

## Applied Learning Project

* Build and train deep neural networks, implement vectorized neural networks, identify architecture parameters, and apply DL to your applications.

* Use best practices to train and develop test sets and analyze bias/variance for building DL applications, use standard NN techniques, apply optimization algorithms, and implement a neural network in TensorFlow.

* Use strategies for reducing errors in ML systems, understand complex ML settings, and apply end-to-end, transfer, and multi-task learning.

* Build a Convolutional Neural Network, apply it to visual detection and recognition tasks, use neural style transfer to generate art, and apply these algorithms to image, video, and other 2D/3D data.

* Build and train Recurrent Neural Networks and its variants (GRUs, LSTMs), apply RNNs to character-level language modeling, work with NLP and Word Embeddings, and use HuggingFace tokenizers and transformers to perform Named Entity Recognition and Question Answering.
